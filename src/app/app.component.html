<h1>Show List from API Data  </h1>

<!--To Do: 
* What is API
* How to fetch API data in service
* Import in component
* Get data in component
* How to show that data in html form which are coming from API
 -->

 <!--Step by step
* Open cmd and create new service
  * command : ng g service service-name   
* To call API we first we have to call HTTP client so we will import http client in users-service.service.ts file
* Then make an instance of that http client (eg:http) in that file
* Then make a function to get data from API (eg:getData) in that file
* Go to app.module.ts file and import Http module  and then register that module into import section 
* Go to  users-data.service.ts file and write return value using get method
* Now go  in that component where you want to fetch data through API (In this case app.component.ts file) 
* Import user service component in that file
* Make a html table in app.component.ts file to show API data
* Define a property in app.component.ts  (eg:allData) file as arrya to store all those data coming from API
* Now to write a for loop to show data in html table (eg:*ngFor)
